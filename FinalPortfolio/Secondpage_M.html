<span style="color: midnightblue; font- ;">" I went to see "Dear Evan Hansen", the new movie musical. My sister was a huge fan of the original musical, but I always just knew the music. I just assumed what it was about, and never really knew until my sister explained it to me recently. My roommates and I were very excited, but it was getting a lot of negative reviews and comments. First of all, Ben Platt is a 27 year old, playing a 17 year old. Although this is a quite a stretch, I don't think it would have worked with anyone else playing that character. During the movie, it was very obvious that Ben is wearing makeup to hide his age. Overall, I really liked the movie. It was so interesting to listen to songs and finally know what they are about. I think the actors did great with their characters, and I especially liked Larry, the dad. He brought more emotion to his part than I expected. 'Sincerely, Me' was SO funny, by far one of the best parts. I think Alana could've had a bigger role, especially since they wrote a new song for her to sing. I greatly enjoyed the entire movie, and I rate it a 4.2/5.</span></p>
